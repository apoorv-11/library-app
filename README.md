### Library Management System

This project is a comprehensive **Library Management System** developed using **Java** and **MySQL**. It allows efficient management of library operations with the following features:

#### Features
- **Admin Login**: Secure login for administrators to manage books and users.
- **Student Login**: Personalized access for students to borrow and return books.
- **Book Inventory Management**: Add, update, and track books in the library.
- **Transaction Management**: Record and monitor borrowing and returning activities.

#### Tech Stack
- **Java**: Core programming language for application logic.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user, book, and transaction data.

#### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
   ```

2. Import the project into your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).

3. Set up the MySQL database:
   - Create a database named `library`.
   - Add required tables (`admins`, `students`, `books`, `transactions`).

4. Update database credentials in the `LibraryManagementSystem` class:
   ```java
   private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library";
   private static final String DB_USER = "root";
   private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "password";
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   javac LibraryManagementSystem.java
   java LibraryManagementSystem
   ```

#### Future Enhancements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Implement search and filter options for books.
- Add email notifications for overdue books.
